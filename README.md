Introduction
===========
This is a new idea for made an application and develop base on GUI and Relation between components,
you can start work and change for each Time, each Position, each Conditions, with or without other, at your likely style.
Also you can Test your own code with use own Machine Learning Algorithm codes for own Data and Dataset for own Design.
If you help us , all of this project can change in other computer language , other GUI interface , other option and tools and ...  
If you sponsor to us , we can write for you at your own design on this idea base.
